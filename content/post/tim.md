got hugo installed on a raspberry pi zero with retropie on it
exiting out of emulationstation stepping into the dark of the terminal. using mweb to upload the photos to imgur. using my computer when i get home to select the image links with the mouse. have yet to find a good way to do that on my phone. touch file. md to create a file. used the documents app to transfer it to my phone. copyed the list of images to the textastic folder conmected to the git repository.

I enjoy this because I don't have to look at the screen to utilise it. 
You lose awareness of the present moment when you stare at the screen. 
You can also feel where the home row landmarks are thanks to the tactile buttons.

oh, i also use ibis-paint to combine photos and add text.

so its all just markdown.
the hugo theme is photophobia. a skeleton. removed a few things in the layout partials. 
- i like being able to git clone the whole folder of text and have all the images seperate. 
- i like how the github actions builds the hugo site quickly. 
- i like that the whole thing was built on a pi zero without a gui. most of the time remoted in.

- i like that it gets around the admin priveleges on the other computer thats way too locked down. cant install anything or do the updates. the pages cant load https warns how your unsafe and to proceed with caution. 
- breathes new life into the computer that was otherwise gathering dust.
- i like emmet shortcuts on textastic and the auto pairs. ive got vim plugoms to do that on the pi also.

its kind of weird to get your head around at first but its so cool once it becomes natural. version control. detatched sessions in screen.
